##TODO_LIST Application

This is a basic To-Do List application using Next.js as its frontend and backend, Tailwind CSS is used for styling. Users can create tasks while they can also display tasks and modify them along with deleting tasks through the application. Used React.js for building user interfaces.

##Steps
I have created this project by making a Next.js application through "create-next-app." Next I installed Tailwind CSS after which I configured the setup by making changes to "tailwind.config.js" and by implementing Tailwind directives in the global CSS file. I have created backend API inside "pages/api/tasks.js" which permits CRUD functionality for tasks. The frontend contains two components which included "TaskForm" to both create and modify tasks and "TaskList" to show and handle tasks. The project is deployed on GitHub before routing it to Vercel to access the live link.
